DETECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN ECG IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING
-> things need to know.
    ->what is ECG and how ECG is used to compute the Heart disease 
    ->what is machine learning and deep learning
    ->how machine learning and deep learning is used in ECG images
    ->what is LSTM and how its working 

ECG or EKG
    ->ECG, short for Electrocardiogram (also known as EKG from the German "Elektrokardiogramm"), 
    is a medical test that records the electrical activity of the Heart over a period of time.
    ->A current which makes the Heart to beat is known as ActionPotential, a system which produce 
    ActionPotential is known as conduction system of the Heart.
    
    ->Conduction System Of The Heart
        ->Consists of 4 parts
            ->SA node(sinoartrial node) -> Natural Pace Maker (produces Electrical Impulse)
            ->AV node(atrialventricular node)
            ->bundle of his
            ->purkinjee fibre

        travelling the pulse from AV node to bundle of his takes the delay of -0.16seconds because
        of diminished gap junction.

        Relaxation { <- SA <-> AV <-> bundle of his <-> purkinjee fibre -> } Contraction

    -> ECG
        mainly to measure the ecg records we need 12 leads,
            among these 12, 6 for limb leads and another 6 for chest limbs
            ->limb leads
                Right arm
                Left arm
                Left leg
            ->chest leads
                V1
                V2
                V3
                V4
                V5
                V6
        gel used to paste these leads are silverchloride(AgCl), bcoz less resistance which gives
        more accurate results.
        ->ECG signal is a time series signal, which is a signal that varies with time.
        ->ECG signal is a periodic signal, which is a signal that repeats itself after a certain
        period of time.
