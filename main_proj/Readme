-> things need to know.
    ->what is ECG and how ECG is used to compute the Heart disease 
    ->what dataset used for this project
    ->what is LSTM and how its working 

1. ECG or EKG
    ->ECG, short for Electrocardiogram (also known as EKG from the German "Elektrokardiogramm"), 
    is a medical test that records the electrical activity of the Heart over a period of time.
    ->A current which makes the Heart to beat is known as ActionPotential, a system which produce 
    ActionPotential is known as conduction system of the Heart.
    
    ->Conduction System Of The Heart
        ->Consists of 4 parts
            ->SA node(sinoartrial node) -> Natural Pace Maker (produces Electrical Impulse)
            ->AV node(atrialventricular node)
            ->bundle of his
            ->purkinjee fibre

        travelling the pulse from AV node to bundle of his takes the delay of -0.16seconds because
        of diminished gap junction.

        Relaxation { <- SA <-> AV <-> bundle of his <-> purkinjee fibre -> } Contraction

    -> ECG
        mainly to measure the ecg records we need 12 leads,
            among these 12, 6 for limb leads and another 6 for chest limbs
            ->limb leads
                Right arm
                Left arm
                Left leg
            ->chest leads
                V1
                V2
                V3
                V4
                V5
                V6
        gel used to paste these leads are silverchloride(AgCl), bcoz less resistance which gives
        more accurate results.
        ->ECG signal is a time series signal, which is a signal that varies with time.
        ->ECG signal is a periodic signal, which is a signal that repeats itself after a certain
        period of time.

1.1 how ECG used to compute heart disease
    -> ECG, a test that measures the electtrical activity of the heart over a period of time.

    After these analyses we came into 5 things
    -> Analysis
    -> Rhythm Detection
    -> Waveform Patterns
    -> Interval Analysis
    -> Detection of Condition

    1.1.1 Analysis
            measure the rate of heartbeats per minute.Abnormalities like bradycardia (too slow) or 
         tachycardia (too fast) can be early indicators of underlying conditions.
    1.1.2 Rhythm Detection
            show the rhythm of heartbeats. Irregular rhythms, known as arrhythmias, can indicate 
        conditions like atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation
    1.1.3 Waveform Detection
            ->P wave: Represents the atrial depolarization. Abnormalities in the P wave can suggest atrial enlargement.
            ->QRS complex: Reflects the ventricular depolarization. Wide QRS complexes can indicate ventricular 
        hypertrophy or blockages.
            ->T wave: Represents ventricular repolarization. Abnormal T waves might suggest ischemia or electrolyte imbalances.
            ->ST Segment: Elevation or depression in the ST segment can indicate myocardial infarction (heart attack) 
        or ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart).
    1.1.4 Interval Analysis
            different waves (e.g., PR, QRS, and QT intervals) provide insight into how effectively the heartâ€™s 
        electrical system is functioning. For example, a prolonged QT interval is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias.
    1.1.5 Detection of Condition
            with help from these analysis we got to know the specific condition of the heart.

2. Dataset used.
    PTB-XL ECG Dataset (PhysioNet)
        ->This dataset is an extension of the PTB database, containing over 20,000 ECG records from clinical settings, 
    labeled with diagnostic information, including cardiovascular conditions.
        ->Data Type: High-quality 12-lead ECGs annotated with disease classes, suitable for 
    machine learning and deep learning.
        
        PTB-XL ECG Dataset: "https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/" a direct link to the page.

        The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21799 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18869 patients of 10 second length.
    The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. 
    The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements. 
    To ensure comparability of machine learning algorithms trained on the dataset, we provide recommended splits into training 
    and test sets. In combination with the extensive annotation, this turns the dataset into a rich resource for the training and 
    the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. The dataset is complemented by extensive metadata on demographics, 
    infarction characteristics, likelihoods for diagnostic ECG statements as well as annotated signal properties.

3. LSTM.
    Define:
        ->LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN).
        ->It is widely used in tasks that involve sequential data, such as time series analysis, speech recognition, 
    and ECG signal processing.

    How it works:
        ->LSTM is composed of memory cells that allow it to remember information over long periods of time.
    achieves this through its internal gating mechanism, which consists of three main gates:
            ->Forget Gate: Determines what information from the previous time step should be discarded (i.e., forgotten).
            ->Input Gate: Decides which new information should be added to the memory.
            ->Output Gate: Determines what information from the memory should be outputted for the current time step.

    LSTM in ECG Detection
        ->In ECG signal analysis, the data consists of time-series sequences of voltage measurements from the heart's 
    electrical activity,can be particularly effective for ECG detection because:

            ->Sequential Data Handling: ECG data is naturally sequential, with each heartbeat generating a new time 
    step of data. LSTM can learn the temporal dependencies between these time steps and capture complex patterns such as 
    changes in heart rate or abnormal rhythms.

            ->Learning Patterns in Heart Activity: An LSTM model can learn to detect normal and abnormal patterns in 
    ECG signals. For example, it can differentiate between regular sinus rhythms and arrhythmias (like atrial fibrillation or 
    ventricular fibrillation). The model can also detect irregularities such as heart blocks, ST-segment elevation, or other signs 
    of myocardial infarction.
